# A-hyrbid-handwritten-digit-classifier-with-CNN-and-SVM-

The current work focuses on the utilization of
convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine
(SVM) algorithms to develop an optical character recognition
(OCR) system for handwritten digit recognition. The extremely
effective feature extraction dynamics of CNN is implemented
to extract important features from digit images, and then
classification of the digits are conducted by SVM algorithm.
Compared to traditional methods of OCR, the hybrid system
provides better accuracy; in the range of 98-99%
