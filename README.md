# A-hyrbid-handwritten-digit-classifier-with-CNN-and-SVM-

The work focuses on the utilization of convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to develop an optical character recognition (OCR) system for handwritten digit recognition. The extremely effective feature extraction dynamics of CNN is implemented to extract important features from digit images, and then classification of the digits are conducted by SVM algorithm. Compared to traditional methods of OCR, the hybrid system provides better accuracy; in the range of 98-99%.
